                <p>When using the logo beside other logos, it should appear at the same height. Always refer to the guidelines of the other logos as well, particularly regarding clear space. As a rule, enough space should be maintained between the logos to ensure their
                  integrity by ensuring that each is distinct and recognizable.In instances where other logos appear in grayscale, you should use the grayscale version of the logo.Note that use of the United Nations logo is restricted to UN organizations and agencies
